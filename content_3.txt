In a dim library, shelves towered like trees in an ancient forest, each book a leaf with a story etched in ink. Dust motes floated lazily through the golden light that filtered in through stained-glass windows. A lone reader turned pages slowly, lips moving silently as if in prayer. Somewhere in the distance, a clock chimed, echoing softly through the hallowed silence.

As the storm rolled in, the forest grew quiet, save for the whisper of wind and the distant rumble of thunder. Leaves shimmered silver in the shifting light, and animals retreated to burrows and nests. Rain began as a patter, then built to a roar, drumming on the canopy and filling the air with a clean, earthy scent. Lightning forked across the sky, illuminating the gnarled trees like giant skeletons.
